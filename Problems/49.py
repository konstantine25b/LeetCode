# 49. Group Anagrams
# Solved
# Medium
# Topics
# Companies
# Given an array of strings strs, group the 
# anagrams
#  together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

# Explanation:


# There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
# The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]

# Output: [[""]]


# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]

# Output: [["a"]]

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        
        anagrams = {}
      
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))

            if sorted_word not in anagrams:
                anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]
            else:
                 anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)
        
        return list(anagrams.values())
